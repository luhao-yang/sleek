For the past year, I have been using Wordpress to host my personal blogs which deployed on VPS from linode.com. The reason I did this is to enjoy the full control of a website while surfing the internet withour any restrictions from China GFW by setting up a Shadowsocks server on it.

Now that I am in NZ now, it seems I don't need it anymore as it costs me money every hour, although not much.

I find the GitHub Pages is the best place for hosting the static pages and Jekyll template engine happens to show me the feasibility of dynamic features with a bunch of plugins. So the answer to the question that whether I should migrate from Wordpress to Jekyll turns out to be, 'Why not?'

Learn more about [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).

>Transform your plain text into static websites and blogs.

You only need a few steps to set up your personal page.

1. Create a repository named ***username***.github.io
2. Set up Jekyll's environment, which requires Ruby, Gem, etc
3. Choose a [Jekyll theme](http://jekyllthemes.org/), unless you want to build from scratch
4. Fork or download it, then make changes to yours
5. Upload to GitHub, done!
